          Hello, my name is KV. I am 18 years old and love technology. I have been learning how to use it for almost 12 years now and I strive to learn more!
        </p>
        <p>
          This is my first website after learning some HTML and CSS. I think I have the basics down but I there are some things that I need to work on (Especially organizing things in a standard style). This version of the website will be up for a while as I want to continue web development when I have a good understanding of Javascript integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, before I commit myself into learning how to integrate Javascript, I want to finish up some other Python projects. Python was an extremely friendly language to learn with it's ease of syntax. Especially coming from much more verbose languages like C# and Java, it feels great to write so little while doing so much. While I understand there are limitations on the Python language, especially when it comes to speed, I think Python might be my favorite language to learn. I still love good ol' Java and C# though.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now for the background to my education in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first time I was exposed to programming and Computer Science was around the 6th grade. I had joined my Middle School robotics team and that pretty much sparked a large interest in programming. On that robotics team, I was able to build Lego robots and program them using a visual language. We got to compete in many fun state competitions and having the robots that I helped create win some rounds was very satisfying. During this time, I also made small Scratch projects which were immensely helpful in teaching me programming logic. Ifs, whiles, and the like were clearly layed out with Scratch and it only reinforced what I learned in robotics. My time in robotics and with Scratch were my first experiences that really launched my interest in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around the end of 7th grade was when I began dipping my toes into "actual" coding. This was a time where I looked into game development and found the Unity game engine, which used C#. Learning C# back then was one of the biggest struggles I had. With no prior knowledge of things like IDEs, compilers, and strict code syntax, I had immense trouble with learning how to use Unity. Many times I wanted to give up, thinking programming might be too hard for me. Luckily, my passion for video-games won out and I was able to gather enough willpower to learn the basics of C# to make a simple game. That breakthrough was around the end of 8th grade. (Dang it really took me 1 year to learn the basic syntax of C#)
        </p>
        <p>
          When it came to High School, my Computer Science education was greatly accelerated compared to my Middle School years. In 9th grade, I took "Intro to Computer Programming," which was a semester course that used Processing, a graphical application that used Java. Since this class was an introduction class, the content my teacher taught was mostly syntax, which I had painstakenly grinded the last year. At first, this made the class really boring as Java syntax was so similar to C#. However, I soon realized that Processing had many of it's own fun capibilities. While I wasn't able to make those crazy cool programs that were featured on the Processing website, I was atleast able to finish some projects of my own that expanded upon the projects we were given in class. I was also able to help others with Processing, and this experience gave me insight on the satisfaction teachers have when teaching. (I don't think I want to be a teacher though üòÅ)
        </p>
        <p>
          With my performance in the introductory programming course, I was able to take AP Computer Science in my Sophomore year. Now this class was a real eye opener for me. In the past, I had thought Computer Science was just computer programming. This was a huge misunderstanding. Unluckily, the teacher in this class was very lax. He was one the the most fun people to be around  (mega memer lol), but his teaching was ineffecient. This caused me to self study for the AP test and basically self study Computer Science principles. I think this is the point where I got to know what was in Computer Science but I couldn't grasp it completely. Like learning C#, trying to learn CS principles with only game coding as experience proved a bit difficult. While studying for the test was quite easy, trying to grasp the abstract concepts was a major challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even with some struggles along the way, what I thought was a highlight of my High School years would be the two games I helped create for SkillsUSA. Cross Contamination and Sub Sinker were both games that made it past regionals and got second place at state. These two games made me really happy and I find them fun to play. You can find out more in my projects page.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>TLDR:</strong> Started with visual scripting but struggled to learn C# for Unity. After taking a programming class and AP Computer Science, I was able to make two games that both got 2nd place at a State level.
        </p>
        <p>
          This leads to now. I am trying to learn more stuff like Web Development and Software Development.

          Oh yeah, did I mention I love to play video games? Catch me on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAsianNinja/" class="link" target="_blank">Steam</a> or <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/u/7358268" class="link" target="_blank">osu!</a>
