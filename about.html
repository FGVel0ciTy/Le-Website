          Hello, my name is KV. I am 18 years old and love technology. I have been learning how to use it for almost 12 years now and I strive to learn more!
        </p>
        <p>
          This is my first website after learning some HTML and CSS. I think I have the basics down but I there are some things that I really need to work on (Especially organizing things). What is probably next is JavaScript but I need to finish learning Python first. I will probably come back to this website and rework the whole thing when I have started learning JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Python I've been working on a web scraper but the GUI (using tkinter) has been a little rough for me. Since I implemented everything to work with text at first, reaching variables within the functions outside of the GUI has been challenging. I have been thinking about duplicating all the functions into the application loop for ease of access rather than making global variables, which are kind of a pain to use so far. Tkinter isn't helping to much either as it seems dated to me or maybe just not robust.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also been working on LeetCode to improve my Algorithm and Data Structure knowledge. Because my foundation with computer science is a pretty weak (self-taught in AP Computer Scicence because the teacher was too laid back) I have found the problems to be challenging but enlightening. Fun stuff
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally I want to get back into game development as a hobby. Sub Sinker is a game I really want to revive and finish. I think the concept is actually really fun and if I could polish it with my friend, it would be a pretty fun game!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love to play video games. Catch me on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAsianNinja/" class="link">Steam</a> or <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/u/7358268" class="link">osu!</a>
