          Hello, my name is KV. I am 18 years old and love technology. I have been learning how to use it for almost 14 years now and I strive to learn more!

          I started programming around middle school where I made game development a hobby. Enamoured with the many games I played, I attempted to make my own games that other people could enjoy. Unity was my game engine of choice as it had such a large community for support and the engine was a powerful tool to make games.
